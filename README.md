RunPerl - A minimal Android app to start a Perl process on Android
==================================================================

RunPerl is a very small Android application which will install a copy of Perl, then run the Perl script found in "uk.me.jandj.runPerl/runperl.pl". It includes a default runperl.pl script which will manipulate the UI of the main Activity, as a demonstration.

RunPerl includes, and extends, a copy of [Object-Remote-Java][orj].

RunPerl is a work in progress.

The RunPerl repo does not include a copy of Perl itself, there is a [downloadable copy of 5.17.4][downloadperl], or you can grab [the whole thing][runperldownload] compiled as a demo application.

For more docs, and a challenge, see: [Jess' blog post][blogpost], and the [Object-Remote-Java docs][ordocs].
